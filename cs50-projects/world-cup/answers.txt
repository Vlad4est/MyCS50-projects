Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The predictions with low sample size.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 simulations beacause the sample size is high enough to draw conclusions and the run time is relatively low (less then 0.01s)
